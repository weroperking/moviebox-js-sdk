Title: fix: add Referer header to download requests to prevent 403 errors
Description:


The CDN (bcdnxw.hakunaymatata.com) requires a Referer header on download requests. Without it, all range download requests return 403 ACCESS DENIED.

Root cause: The downloadMediaFile function was sending fetch requests with only the Range header, missing the required Referer.

Fix:

Added a default Referer: https://fmoviesunblocked.net/ header to all download requests
Added an optional headers parameter to DownloadBaseParams so users can override or add custom headers
User-supplied headers take precedence over defaults
Files changed:

src/download.ts — added DOWNLOAD_HEADERS constant, merged into fetch calls, added headers option
src/download.test.ts — added 2 new tests verifying Referer behavior
