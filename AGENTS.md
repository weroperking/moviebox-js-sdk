# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview
This is a JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for interacting with MovieBox APIs. It includes examples for Express, Next.js, and Vue integrations.

## Rules
- Prefer TypeScript for new code and examples.
- Use clear, descriptive function and variable names.
- Document all public APIs in the docs folder.
- Keep examples up-to-date with the main API.
- Use pnpm for dependency management.

## Environment Setup
- Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
- Use `pnpm add <package>` to add new dependencies.

## Build Steps
- Build with TypeScript using `tsc`.
- Use `tsconfig.json` for configuration.

## Testing
- Run tests with `pnpm test` (uses Vitest).
- Add new tests for all new features and bug fixes.

## Coding Conventions
- Use ES modules (`import/export`).
- Prefer async/await for asynchronous code.
- Follow the existing formatting and linting rules.

## Hierarchy
- Place context-specific AGENTS.md files in subdirectories if needed for specialized instructions.

## Additional Notes
- Keep documentation in the docs folder clear and concise.
- Update ROADMAP.md for major changes or planned features.
